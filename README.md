# MudPi Diagrams
Diagrams for several basic examples of hardware configurations for [MudPi](mudpi.app) that showcase different parts of the system. Schematics are created in [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) to demonstrate the hardware in a prototype setting. The schematics are then exported to a PDF. Then [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is used to export as a PNG with a transparent background.

The following diagrams are included or to be included.
